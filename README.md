# Tuuuuunes
Script / Info for filling a USB stick with the latest DJ sets.

Requires wget and lynx. I could have probably not used lynx but hey, I like it !

geturls.sh is not intended to be ran. I have no idea how large a mirror of the entire site would be.
Just run the first line untill you have a few 100MB's of raw html..
Then run the second line to extract the zippyshare pages to produce a list of download URLs.

grumble.sh is definately runnable and works well. Make sure you are in the root dir of your usb stick. It will grind to a halt when wget runs out of space !
